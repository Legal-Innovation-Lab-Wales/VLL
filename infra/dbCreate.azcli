# currently using the gui 
# after creating the rg
# create new SQL Database (which creates the SQL Server for you)

# **VCore was more expensive** - way more.
# experimenting with new vcore purchasing model as it is the default now 
# old model is DTU which is fine too


# db, craete server firewall
# public, add your client IPv4
# to get access from desktop
# allow access from Azure exception to allow access from the webserver
# don't have auto pause on db (as takes a while to start back up especially from SSMS maybe a minute?)

# SQL Server
# SQL Database

# Â£4.15 per month
# service tier = basic
# DTU = 5
# 2 GB max


# possbily use commands like to do from cli
# az sql server create -l ${region} -g ${rg} -n vllserver -u dave -p
